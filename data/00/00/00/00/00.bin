  |   "Behind The Screen" is a suspense puzzle action game, set in Taiwan   |
  |   of an age when the internet was still not common, tracing the life    |
  |   of "a certain murderer", seeking the truth which has been bent and    |
  |   can no longer be distinguished.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Why did the young man who got arrested as his father's murderer had   |
  |   such an ending? Looking back at his childhood, boyhood, and to the    |
  |   moments leading up to the incident, the player will face truth and    |
  |   conflict.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   During a nervous and mature childhood, incapable of separating        |
  |   reality and dreams, the world started looking like an eerie and       |
  |   fantastic place.                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   During his boyhood, he condemned the powers that be as an honest      |
  |   student reporter, and to get himself excited, he would impersonate    |
  |   ancient soldiers and politicians.                                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Did the young man, who ended up becoming "a certain murderer" that    |
  |   day and who still kept resisting, gain anything from facing           |
  |   himself?                                                              |

  |   The player will re-experience the murderer's life, solve several      |
  |   mysteries, and search for the truth through the eyes of the           |
  |   murderer.                                                             |
